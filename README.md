# X-hellraiser-cuffs
As Excel is too often used for making analysts and coders cry, something needs to be done

Well-meaning people often are, without realizing it, hellraisers on data.
Therefore anybody starting to type in Excel, who hasn't read [this carpentries.org lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/) should immediately be cuffed and led away to a room to study that lesson. It could be a service of the 'Digital Competence Center' often/soon available in much of higher education.

If you actually want or need more:
- [oversimplified ultra-summary of FAIR data principles](https://srs.saxion.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SRS_poster_2019_FAIR-724x1024.jpg), from there go to [GO_FAIR](https://go-fair.org) for the real deal.
- [Data-centric Manifesto](http://datacentricmanifesto.org/) Data 1st!, applications should be 'mere visitors'.
- [a research Data Management Plan template](https://srs.saxion.nl/dmp_template/)
- My brainstorm- [ideas on getting&using data FAIR&early in happy cooperation workflows](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asteltenpower+fair-early)
