# pre-Excel-present
Well-meaning people using Excel, are without realizing it, making analysts and coders cry for inefficiency reasons.
This is very costly, both financially and emotionally, and must be improved:
- I suggest to have everybody invest a few hours in ["Data Organization in Spreadsheets ..."](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/).
- Advertise this everywhere, including in the default 'new Excel sheet'. Maybe make this sheet pre-structured, like what I made a rough sketch for in the Excel file in [spreadSheetVariants](https://github.com/steltenpower/SpreadsheetVariants)
- Questions will arise and Digital Competence Centers should be great for answering them

If you actually want or need more:
- [oversimplified ultra-summary of FAIR data principles](https://srs.saxion.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SRS_poster_2019_FAIR-724x1024.jpg), from there go to [GO_FAIR](https://go-fair.org) for the real deal.
- [Data-centric Manifesto](http://datacentricmanifesto.org/) Data 1st!, applications should be 'mere visitors'.
- [a research Data Management Plan template](https://srs.saxion.nl/dmp_template/)
- My brainstorm- [ideas on getting&using data FAIR&early in happy cooperation workflows](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asteltenpower+fair-early)

Excel is not all bad if you know how to use it, plus there are nice extensions:
- [E2D3](https://e2d3.org) (Excel to D3, where D3 stands for Data Driven Documents; aka the most used library for defining your own visualisations)
- [Excel querying Linked Open Data cloud](https://mobile.twitter.com/kidehen/status/1248711829070774274)
